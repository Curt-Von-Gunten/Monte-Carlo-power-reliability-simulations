# Monte-Carlo-power-reliability-simulations
This project:
  1) Analyzes internal reliability as a function of number of subjects and number of trials.
  2) Analyzes statistical power and standardized effect size as a function of number of subject, number of trials, effect magnitude (in original units), and design-type (between- vs. within-subjects).

The power function can be used by researchers to conduct power simulations for their laboratory tasks.

Here is the publication:
